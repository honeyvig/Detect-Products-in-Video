### Sample Python Code

#### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy pandas pytesseract
```

#### Step 2: Load Pre-trained Model (YOLO Example)

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]
```

#### Step 3: Video Processing and Product Detection

```python
def detect_products(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        height, width, channels = frame.shape

        # Prepare the frame for the model
        blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
        net.setInput(blob)
        outs = net.forward(output_layers)

        # Process the outputs
        for out in outs:
            for detection in out:
                scores = detection[5:]
                class_id = np.argmax(scores)
                confidence = scores[class_id]

                if confidence > 0.5:  # Confidence threshold
                    # Object detected
                    center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                    center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                    w = int(detection[2] * width)
                    h = int(detection[3] * height)

                    # Rectangle coordinates
                    x = int(center_x - w / 2)
                    y = int(center_y - h / 2)

                    # Draw rectangle and label
                    cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                    label = f"Product {class_id}: {confidence:.2f}"
                    cv2.putText(frame, label, (x, y - 5), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)

        cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example usage
detect_products("path_to_video.mp4")
```

#### Step 4: Data Extraction with OCR

```python
import pytesseract

def extract_text_from_image(image):
    # Convert to gray scale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply OCR
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray)
    return text

# Example usage after detecting a product
detected_image = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]  # Crop the detected product
product_info = extract_text_from_image(detected_image)
print("Extracted Product Information:", product_info)
```

### Conclusion

This code provides a foundation for detecting products in videos and extracting relevant information. You can further enhance the project by:

- **Improving Model Accuracy**: Fine-tune the object detection model with custom datasets.
- **Data Structuring**: Implement a method to store and retrieve the extracted product information (e.g., using a database).
- **User Interface**: Create a simple UI to visualize the detected products and their information.
